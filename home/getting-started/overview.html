<p>Star Kingdoms is a free-to-play, space-themed, text-based, 4X strategy MMORPG, where you rule over a kingdom and compete for dominance with your friends in a universe filled with other kingdoms.</p>
<p>It will take not only skill, but teamwork, political acumen and sometimes sacrifice to navigate your path to victory.</p>
<p>The game itself operates in real time as a series of turns, called ticks, which process logic every 30 minutes at XX:00:00 and XX:30:00 to explore new lands, construct buildings, train military units and much more.</p>
<p>The primary server (S1) is reset for a new round every month and sign-ups are open for a few days at the beginning of each month. There is also a classic server (S2) which is based on a simpler, early version of the game. Our focus will be to familiarise you with the full version of the game on S1.</p>
<p>To get started, let's make an account and sign up here: <a href="https://starkingdoms.net/SignUp.aspx">https://starkingdoms.net/SignUp.aspx</a></p>
<p>Your kingdom name will be visible to everyone, and your ruler name will be revealed by reconnaissance and in-game messages. There is a limit of 24 characters.</p>
<p>If you are brand new to Star Kingdoms, the planet types Volcanic Inferno, Terra Form or Multiple Terrain offer a gentle introduction, depending which planet types are in rotation. Generally, the races Terran and Gistrami will start strong and allow you to set a good pace. If the round hasn't yet begun, select default, you can change your planet type and race later on.</p>
