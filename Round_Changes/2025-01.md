# January 2025

1. **Food SOX no longer consume PAs**  
   SOXing food or using autobuilder will no longer consume PAs on food, however you need to have 1 PA in order to be able to SOX.

2. **Robbing Food and Mining Gold is the Same**  
   -- Mine Gold Impact  
   -- 6k Probes = 39k (6.5 × 6k)  
   -- 10k Probes = 65k (6.5 × 10k)  
   -- 15k Probes = 97.5k (6.5 × 15k)  
   -- 20k Probes = 110k (6.5 × 15k + 2.5 × 5k)  
   -- 25k Probes = 122.5k (6.5 × 15k + 2.5 × 10k)

   Increased Ceiling on Mine Gold:  
   Mine gold now has a maximum of `100k + 50 × Res + 100 × SM`.

3. **Fighters consume 0.7 Power, same as Goons**
